# Lending Club Case Study

## Problem Statement

### Business Understanding:
You are working for a consumer finance company that specializes in providing various types of loans to urban customers. The
company faces a critical decision-making process when evaluating loan applications, balancing two primary risks:
    ➢ Loss of Business: If a loan is not approved for an applicant who is likely to repay, the company misses out on potential
business.
    ➢ Financial Loss: If a loan is approved for an applicant who is likely to default, the company incurs a financial loss.

### Objective:
The dataset provided includes information on past loan applicants and their repayment status. The objective is to identify
patterns that predict the likelihood of default, which can inform decisions such as loan denial, loan amount adjustment, or
offering loans at higher interest rates to riskier applicants.
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand how consumer and loan attributes influence default tendencies.
  ❖ When a loan is approved, it can result in one of three outcomes:
     o fully paid,
     o currently being paid
     o charged-off (defaulted)
  ❖ If a loan is rejected, there is no transactional history available for those applicants.
  
The goal is to develop a model that helps the company make informed loan approval decisions to minimize financial risks and
maximize business opportunities.
